# Status

Currently this a Work in Progress. Please take a look in the "issues" tab to join discussions, and help with ideas and things. Feel free to open new issues with questions of discussion points on the overall project. We also have a slack for day-to-day discussions.

# Goals

The current goals of the AssemblyScript project are:

* Support the "latest and greatest" features added into WebAssembly.

* Focus on developer experience, and try to be a great language for new and existing web developers. 

* Compliment current web projects, and support building WebAssembly modules "from scratch". By offering "fine-grain" control to developers.

* Create tools and projects to align with popular WebAssembly platforms (web browsers, serverless, blockchain, etc...).

* Preserve a **lightweight** runtime, and utilize platform APIs as they are added to accomplish high-level features.

# Core Team
