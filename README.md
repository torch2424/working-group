# Goals

The current goals of the AssemblyScript project are:

* Target feature parity with WebAssembly and related technology.

* Support non-browser use cases well (i.e. serverless, blockchain, etc...).

* Compliment current web projects, and support building WebAssembly modules "from scratch". By offering "fine-grain" control to developers.

* Focus on developer experience, and try to be a great language for new and existing web developers. 

# Core Team

The "core team" are active members of the project trying to help the project (and its communitty) grow and be the best it can be. That being said, All contributors are welcome, and very much appreciated. If you have already / plan to continue making significant contributions to the project (either in code, maintenance, evangelism, etc..) please feel free to open an issue to request to join!

To contact the core team: feel free to reach out to members individually. An email alias for the core team is planned to be created soon.

# Governance

Following the [definitions described in opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/#what-are-some-of-the-common-governance-structures-for-open-source-projects). The Governance for the project is split into two parts:

## Technical Decisions

Technical Decisions can be interpreted as contributions being made to projects in the AssemblyScript Github Org.

For this, we will be following BDFL. Daniel Wirtz (@dcodeIO) is the designated lead.

## Organizational Decisions:

Organizational Descisions can be interpreted as contributions to the general project direction, goals, roadmap, maintainers, etc...

For this, we will be following Liberal contribution. Where consensus will be requested on issues opened on this repo to get a communitty vote, and can find a path going forward.
